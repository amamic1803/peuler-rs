**Project Euler** (named after Leonhard Euler) is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs.
The project attracts graduates and students interested in mathematics and computer programming.
Since its creation in 2001 by Colin Hughes, Project Euler has gained notability and popularity worldwide.
It includes 800 problems as of 30 May 2022, with a new one added approximately every week.
Problems are of varying difficulty, but each is solvable in less than a minute of CPU time using an efficient algorithm on a modestly powered computer.
As of 27 April 2021, Project Euler has more than 1,000,000 users who have solved at least one problem, in over 100 different programming languages.
