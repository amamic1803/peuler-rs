        // we can think of T(n), P(n) and H(n) as sequences of natural numbers

        // every triangular number is also hexagonal
        // proof:
        // T(n) = n(n+1)/2
        // H(m) = m(2m-1)
        // T(n) = H(m)
        // n(n+1)/2 = m(2m-1)
        // n(n+1) = 2m(2m-1)
        // n(n+1) =(2m-1)2m
        // from there we can read that
        // n = 2m-1
        // therefore for every hexagonal number at index m there is equal triangular number at index n=2m-1
        // so we can say that H(m) = T(2m-1)

        // now we know that if a number is hexagonal, then
        // it is also triangular so we don't have to check if it is triangular

        // let n be a natural number bigger than 1
        // it can be proven (by induction) that P(n) < H(n) for all n > 1
        // that means that we can generate hexagonal numbers and check if they are pentagonal
        // which is more efficient than generating pentagonal numbers and checking if they are hexagonal

        // the problem says that we are searching for number bigger than H(143) so we can start from 144
        let mut n = 144;
        let mut hex_num = n * (2 * n - 1);

        // in each iteration we increase n by 1 and calculate the next hexagonal number
        while !is_pentagonal(hex_num) {
            n += 1;
            hex_num = n * (2 * n - 1);
        }

fn is_pentagonal(num: u64) -> bool {
    // when we know Pn (num) we can calculate n by solving the quadratic equation
    // 3n^2 - n - 2Pn = 0
    // n = (1 + sqrt(1 + 24Pn)) / 6
    // (as Pn is equal to or bigger than 1, we know that the square root is bigger than or equal to 5,
    // therefore the other solution would be negative so we can ignore it because n is a natural number)
    let i = (1.0 + ((1 + 24 * num) as f64).sqrt()) / 6.0;
