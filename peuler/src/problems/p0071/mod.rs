        // the next fraction that would appear between a/b and c/d is (a+c)/(b+d)
        // so we just need to find the neighbour that is smaller than 3/7
        // and check that b + d > 1_000_000 (that means that there is no fraction between them in the Farey sequence)
        // plugging in the C and D values we get:
        // 3b - 7a = 1
        // a = (3b - 1) / 7
